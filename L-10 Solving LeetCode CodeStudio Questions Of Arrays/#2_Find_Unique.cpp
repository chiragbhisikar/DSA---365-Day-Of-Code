/**
 *  Find Unique
//
Problem statement
You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N. Where N is equal to [2M + 1].

Now, in the given array/list, 'M' numbers are present twice and one number is present only once.

You need to find and return that number which is unique in the array/list.

 Note:
Unique element is always present in the array/list according to the given condition.

Sample Input 1:
1
7
2 3 1 6 3 6 2
Sample Output 1:
1
Explanation: The array is [2, 3, 1, 6, 3, 6, 2]. Here, the numbers 2, 3, and 6 are present twice, and the number 1 is present only once. So, the unique number in this array is 1.

Sample Input 2:
2
5
2 4 7 2 7
9
1 3 1 3 6 6 7 10 7
Sample Output 2:
4
Explanation: In the first test case, the array is [2, 4, 7, 2, 7]. Here, the numbers 2 and 7 are present twice, and the number 4 is present only once. So, the unique number in this array is 4.

10
Explanation: In the second test case, the array is [1, 3, 1, 3, 6, 6, 7, 10, 7]. Here, the numbers 1, 3, 6, and 7 are present twice, and the number 10 is present only once. So, the unique number in this array is 10.
